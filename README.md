## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full-stack developer, but not just any developer. I'm a developer with a love for Angular that's as expansive as the universe itself! With over 5 years of experience, I've journeyed through the cosmos of HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, NodeJs, React, and JavaScript, gathering knowledge and honing my skills.
